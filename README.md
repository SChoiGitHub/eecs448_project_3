Team 8 Project 3 EECS 448 Spring 2018 University of Kansas

The idea for project 3 is a social-media clone. The prototype should have basic posting and user functionality.

The project is currently set up using Maven. Use an IDE like eclipse to utilize it.

Creation of the JAR file ("project-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar") is done with the command "mvn install" on this directory.
